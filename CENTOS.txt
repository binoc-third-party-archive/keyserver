CentOS packaging

This is the process to release KeyExchange as a RPM collection.

It requires a few tools::

    $ yum install rpm-build python26 python26-setuptools
    $ easy_install-2.6 virtualenv


Next, call make build to pull dependencies and set up a build environment::

    $ make build

To check that the environment works, make test should not fail::

    $ make test


Now you can create an RPM for the project and its dependencies::

    $ make build_rpm

If you need a RPM for SyncCore, you can create one from the subrepos located in deps/::

    $ make build_core

Once this is over, you should have these rpm in rpms/:

- python26-webob
- python26-paste
- python26-pastedeploy
- python26-synccore
- python26-keyexchange

Then you can install python26-keyexchange with Yum will install all
dependencies, including those we've created.
