CentOS packaging

This is the process to release KeyExchange as a RPM collection.


It requires a few tools::

    $ yum install rpm-build python26 python26-setuptools
    $ easy_install-2.6 pypi2rpm
    $ easy_install-2.6 Distutils2


Next, create an RPM for every dependency, using pypi2rpm::

    $ pypi2rpm.py WebOb
    $ pypi2rpm.py Paste
    $ pypi2rpm.py PasteDeploy


For sync-core, since there's no release yet::

    $ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/services/server-core
    $ pypi2rpm.py server-core


Last, for KeyExchange itself::

    $ python2.6 setup.py bdist_rpm


Once this is over, you should have these rpm:

- python-webob
- python-paste
- python-pastedeploy
- python-synccore
- python-keyexchange

Installing python-keyexchange with Yum will install all dependencies,
including those we created.
